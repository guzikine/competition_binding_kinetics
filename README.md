# competition_binding_kinetics
This repository contains a R script designed to analyze BRET data from competition binding kinetics assays. The script processes data obtained using BODIPY-cyclopamine and an unknown ligand on Nluc-SMO and âˆ†CRD Nluc-SMO cells. Main objective is to calculate inhibition constant (Ki) using the Cheng-Persoff equation.
